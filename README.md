# Hi everyone!

This is my first React based web-app project.
It is a basic text utilities provider with about 6 functions.
Hope you like it.

I have been referring to a YouTube course on the channel CodeWithHarry.
If anyone is interesred, here is a link : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agx66oZnT6IyhcMIbUMNMdt&si=1tHbDYSz5M1ej4-Q

It has been really helpful in my efforts to learn React.
